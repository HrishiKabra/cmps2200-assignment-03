# CMPS 2200 Assignment 3

In this assignment we'll look at the greedy and dynamic programming paradigms.

**To make grading easier, please place all written solutions directly in `answers.md`, rather than scanning in handwritten work or editing this file.**

All coding portions should go in `main.py` as usual.


## Part 1: Making Change

The pandemic is over and you decide to take a much needed vacation. You arrive in a city called Geometrica, and head to the bank to
exchange $N$ dollars for local currency. In Geometrica they have a
currency that is 1-1 with U.S. Dollars, but they only have
coins. Moreover the coins are in
denominations of powers of $2$ (e.g., $k$ denominations of values $2^0$, $2^1$, \ldots,
$2^k$). You wonder why they have
such strange denominations. You think about it a while, and because
you had such a good Algorithms instructor, you realize that there is a
very clever reason. 

**1a)** Given a $N$ dollars, state a greedy algorithm for producing as few coins as possible that sum to $N$.

**1b)** Prove that this algorithm is optimal by proving the greedy choice and optimal substructure properties.

**1c)** What is the work and span of your algorithm?

## Part 2: Making Change Again

You get tired of Geometrica and travel to the nearby town of
Fortuito. While Fortuito also has a 1-1 exchange rate to the US
Dollar, it has an even stranger system of currency where any given bank
has a completely arbitrary set of denominations ($k$ denominations of
values $D_0, D_2, \ldots, D_k$). There is no guarantee that you can
even make change. So you wonder, given $N$ dollars is it possible to
even make change? If so, how can it be done with as few coins as
possible?

**2a)** You realize the greedy algorithm you devised above doesn't work in Fortuito. Give a simple counterexample that shows that the greedy algorithm does not produce the fewest number of coins.

**2b)** Since you paid attention in Algorithms class, you realize that while this problem does not have the greedy choice property it does have an optimal substructure property. State and prove this property.

**enter answer in `answers.md`**


**2c)** Use this optimal substructure property to design a dynamic programming algorithm for this problem. If you used top-down or bottom-up memoization to avoid recomputing solutions to subproblems, what is the work and span of your approach?

## Part 3: Edit Distance

In class we proved an optimal substructure property for the **Edit
Distance** problem. This allowed us to implement a simple recursive
algorithm in Python that was horribly inefficient. **Please only consider insertion and deletion**.


**3a)** The code for `MED` and `top-down MED` from the lecture notes is provided as a
  starting point in `main.py.` Now implement `fast_MED`, a **bottom-up**
  memoized version of `MED`. Test your implementation code using `test_MED`.


**3b)** Now that you have implemented an efficient algorithm for
  computing edit distance, let's turn to the problem of identifying
  the actual edits between two sequences. **The given alignment is just one solution. If you algorithm outputs, still valid**.

 Notice that in the process of computing the optimal edit
  distance, we can also keep track of the actual sequence of edits to
  each position of $S$ and $T$. Update your implementation of `fast_MED` to
  return the optimal edit distance as well as an *alignment* of the
  two strings which show the edits that yield this distance. An
  alignment just shows what changes are made to $S$ to transform it to
  $T$. For example, suppose $S$=`relevant` and $T$=`elephant`. If
  insertion and deletion costs are both equal to $1$, then the
  edit distance between $S$ and $T$ is 4 and an
  alignment of these two strings would look like this:

  `relev--ant`\
  `-ele-phant`

Implement `fast_align_MED` to return the aligned versions of $S$ and $T$,
and test your code with `test_alignment`.
